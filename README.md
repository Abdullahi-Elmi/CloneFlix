## CLONEFLIX

This is a full-stack web application project, I originally developed in Feb.2023. A classic full-stack project for developers to showcase their abilities: re-creating a well known full-stack application. 

I recently decided to create an updated version as there was a significant Next.js version release in May 2023 that changed things significantly and I wanted to practice my understanding of these changes by successfully migrating an older project to the current Next.js version. 

## Technologies

The project was written in typescript

The tech stack for this project consists of:
- **React / Next.js:** For the front-end
- **Tailwind:** For the CSS/UI
- **Node.js:** For the backend
- **MongoDB:** For the database

Other tools include:
- **Prisma:** ORM for the database
- **NextAuth:** Authentication library to sync with any OAuth service
- **Vercel:** Deployment

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
